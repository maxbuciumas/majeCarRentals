# Car rental website

I made this repo so I can learn to use Git and GitHub while also improving my front-end skills.
  // this website will have only the homepage, meaning that the links don't work.

Things left to do:
- add the location search form in cta (DONE)
- design the rest of the page
- add two transitions for learning purposes (DONE)
- make the website responsive
